Problem Statement :
There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer n, indicating that you must do the following routine for n minutes:

At the first minute, color any arbitrary unit cell blue.
Every minute thereafter, color blue every uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.
Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes 1, 2, and 3.


Approach :
just found a mathematical relation
The pattern of added cells follows an arithmetic sequence: 4, 8, 12, 16, ...
This sequence can be represented as 4 * (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)
For minute n, the number of added cells is 4 * (n-1)
The total number of added cells is the sum of this sequence: 4 * (1 + 2 + ... + (n-1))
This sum is calculated by the formula: 4 * ((n-1) * n / 2)

Therefore, the total number of cells at minute n is: 1 + 4 * (n * (n-1) / 2)
