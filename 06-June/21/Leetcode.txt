Problem Statement : 
You are given a string word and an integer k.

We consider word to be k-special if |freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k for all indices i and j in the string.

Here, freq(x) denotes the frequency of the character x in word, and |y| denotes the absolute value of y.

Return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make word k-special.

 




Approach : 
1 . Count Frequencies:
First, we count how many times each character appears in the string using a frequency map.

2 . Sort Frequencies:
We collect these frequency counts into a list and sort them in ascending order. This helps us systematically analyze the frequencies.

3 . Find Minimum Deletions:
For each frequency in the sorted list, we treat it as a potential "base" frequency.
We then calculate how many deletions would be needed to make all other frequencies fall within the range [base, base + k]:
For frequencies smaller than the base: We must delete all of them (since we can't increase frequencies, only decrease)
For frequencies larger than base + k: We reduce them to exactly base + k by deleting the excess characters
We keep track of the minimum deletions needed across all possible base frequencies.
