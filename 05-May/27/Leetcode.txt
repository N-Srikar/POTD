Problem Statement : 
You are given positive integers n and m.

Define two integers as follows:

num1: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are not divisible by m.
num2: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are divisible by m.

Return the integer num1 - num2.





Approach : 
Calculate the total sum of all integers from 1 to n and store it in totalSum.

Find how many numbers from 1 to n are divisible by m. Store this count in divisibleCount.

Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n that are divisible by m. Store this in divisibleSum.

Subtract twice the divisibleSum from the totalSum:

This gives the difference between the sum of non-divisible numbers and the sum of divisible numbers.

Return the result.
