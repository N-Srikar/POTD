Problem Statement : 
You are given a directed graph of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array edges of size n, indicating that there is a directed edge from node i to node edges[i]. If there is no outgoing edge from i, then edges[i] == -1.

You are also given two integers node1 and node2.

Return the index of the node that can be reached from both node1 and node2, such that the maximum between the distance from node1 to that node, and from node2 to that node is minimized. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the smallest index, and if no possible answer exists, return -1.

Note that edges may contain cycles.







Approach : 
Create a distance array from node1 using getDistances(). 
This records the distance to all nodes reachable from node1.

Similarly, create a distance array from node2.

Iterate through all nodes and:
Check if the node is reachable from both node1 and node2.
Track the node that minimizes the maximum of the two distances.

Return the node with the minimum such maximum distance.
