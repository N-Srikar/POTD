Problem Statement : 
You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a character x.
Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x.
Note that the returned array may be in any order.




Approach : 
1 . Initialize a List: We start by creating an empty list to store the indices of the strings that contain the target character.

2 . Iterate Through Each String: For each string in the input array, we check if the target character is present.

3 . Check for Character Presence: Using the indexOf method, we determine if the character exists in the current string. If indexOf returns a non-negative value, the character is present.

4 . Record the Index: If the character is found in the string, we add the current index to our list.

5 . Return the Result: After processing all strings, we return the list of indices where the character was found.
