Problem Statement :
There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits "How many rabbits have the same color as you?" and collected the answers in an integer array answers where answers[i] is the answer of the ith rabbit.

Given the array answers, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.



Approach :
Sort the answers to easily group the same values.

For each value:
If the value is 0, that rabbit is unique  add 1 to the result.

If this is the start of a new group:
Add k + 1 to the result (new group of that color).
Track how many more of that type we can accept.

If weâ€™re still inside a valid group:
Just fill the group by decreasing the count.

Time Complexity : O(n logn)
Space Complexity : O(1)
