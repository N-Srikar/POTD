Problem Statement :
Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still have done this at most once.

You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type.





Approach : 
Start with count = 1 (the original string is always possible).

Loop through the string and check if current character == previous character.
If yes, it means Alice might have pressed this key too long â†’ increase count by 1.

Return count.
