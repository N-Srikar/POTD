1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String
________________________________________________________

class Solution {
    public String makeFancyString(String s) {
        char prev = s.charAt (0);
        int freq = 1;
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder ();
        res.append (s.charAt (0));
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length (); i++) {
            if (s.charAt (i) == prev)
                freq++;
            else {
                prev = s.charAt (i);
                freq = 1;
            }
            if (freq < 3)
                res.append (s.charAt (i));

Problem Statement :
A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

Given a string s, delete the minimum possible number of characters from s to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.





Approach : 
Append the first character to the result (no point deleting it!).
Keep a prev variable and a freq variable marking the frequency of the character seen just before. Initialize prev with the first character of the string and freq with 1.
If the current character is equal to prev, increment freq by 1, else change prev to the current character and reset freq = 1.
If freq < 3, append the current character to the result, else skip the character.
After the loop ends, return the resultant string.
