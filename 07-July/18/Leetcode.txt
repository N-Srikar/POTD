Problem Statement : 
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.

You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. 
The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:
The first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sumfirst.
The next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sumsecond.

The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.

For example, if sumfirst = 3 and sumsecond = 2, their difference is 1.
Similarly, if sumfirst = 2 and sumsecond = 3, their difference is -1.

Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.






Approach : 
We use a max-heap to build leftMins by tracking the smallest k elements from the left.
We use a min-heap to build rightMaxs by tracking the largest k elements from the right.
Iterate through valid split points and compute:
min(leftMins[i] - rightMaxs[i+1])






Complexity : 
Time Complexity : O(n log(n))
Space Complexity : O(n)
